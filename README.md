# FIRRTL-AST

This rust library provides a [FIRRTL](https://www.chisel-lang.org/firrtl/) AST
representation and associated utilities, including a parser and formatter.

This library was mainly developed based on the perpetually outdated [FIRRTL
specification](https://github.com/chipsalliance/firrtl/blob/master/spec/spec.pdf)
and the ANTLR grammar. Thus, some features not lined out in the specification
are only supported on the grounds of guesswork regarding their semantics and
relation, or not at all.
